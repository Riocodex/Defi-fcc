What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?
Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services.

Some of the key attractions of DeFi for many consumers are:

1)It eliminates the fees that banks and other financial companies charge 
for using their services.
2)You hold your money in a secure digital wallet instead of keeping it 
in a bank.
3)Anyone with an internet connection can use it without needing approval.
4)You can transfer funds in seconds and minutes.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
1)Decentralized finance, or DeFi, uses emerging technology to remove 
third parties in financial transactions.
2)The components of DeFi are stablecoins, software, and hardware that 
enables the development of applications.
3)The infrastructure for DeFi and its regulation are still under 
development and debate.
